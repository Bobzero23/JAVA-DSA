Linked list is just like a train, it has a head and a tail and the independent cars.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LINKED LISTS AND ARRAYS
+ Linked list has links between its elements
+ Linked list has good for inserting and deleting elements
+ Linked list is better for shifting elements
+ You don't have to initialize the size of the linked list while creating it
+ Arrays are better for small data set

TYPES OF LINKED LISTS
+ Singly Linked list -> a normal linked list every element has address of the previous element
+ Circular Singly Linked list -> a normal singly linked list with the tail has a reference to the head
+ Doubly Linked list -> every element has the address of the next and the previous element
+ Circular Doubly Linked list -> a doubly linked list with the tail has a reference to the head


HOW TO IMPLEMENT A SINGLY LINKED LIST
+ Create an empty head and tail
+ Create an empty node
+ Initialize the data type of the node
+ link the tail and the head with a created node

INSERTION IN SINGLY LINKED LIST
+ IF THERE IS NOTHING IN THE LINKED LIST
- Simply connect the head and the tail to the new created node
+ TO THE BEGINNING
- Node.next = head
- Head = node
+ TO THE MIDDLE
- Find location(loop)
- Current.next = node
- Node.next = Next_node
+ TO THE LAST
- Node.next = null
- Last.next = node
- Tail = node
