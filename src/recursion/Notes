Recursion is a way of solving of solving problems by having the method calling itself.
* It performs a same operation with different inputs.
* At the end the base condition has to stop otherwise infinite loop will occur
  so we have to provide the base condition.
* It is stored in the Stack memory.

Why we need recursion?
* Recursive thinking is very important to a Programmer.
* Trees and Graphs DSA
* Interviews

When to choose recursion?
* If you can divide a problem to a smaller problem
* Design an algorithm to compute n-th
* Write a code to list the n
* Implement a method to compute all
* Tree traversal
* Practice

When to avoid recursion
* When time and space matters

Recursion vs Iteration
* Iteration performs better in terms of space and time
