                                                    ARRAYS
1. They store the data of a specific type, you can't store string and integer together.
2. Elements are located contiguously
3. Each element has unique index
4. The size is predefined and can not be changed

TYPES OF ARRAYS
1. Single Array -> only have one row and multiple columns
2. Multi dimensional Array -> can have more than one rows and columns
Note: three dimensional Arrays are rarely used but once you encounter them think like a 3x3 rubik cube, think as there
      are three two dimensional Arrays and there is a thing called depth so to find a particular index first, you write
      the name of the array, then the depth, then then row and finally column is gonna be like this arr[0][2][1].

ARRAYS IN MEMORY
Note: All type of Arrays are located as one row and contiguously.

CREATING AN ARRAY
1. First we declare -> here the compiler creates a reference for the array in the memory
2. Instantiation -> here the compiler creates the memory according to the size of the array and also giving value to
                    each index according to the reference we created + 0,
Note: By default it sets all the elements in array as ZERO. To avoid this use constructor.
3. Initialization -> here you assign the values to the array

Note: To display an Array you need to import it is library called Arrays and then use the toString method, check Demo
Note: Array initialization if you do for each element it takes O(N), if you do all in the one line it takes O(1) time.

INSERTION IN ARRAY
ACCESSING IN ARRAY ->We use index to access the elements in the array, it takes O(1)
DELETION IN ARRAY -> Normally deletion is not possible in array but many programmer tend to change a
                     certain index to a minimum integer value
