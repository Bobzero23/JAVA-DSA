BIG O NOTATION

TYPES OF BIG O NOTATIONS
BIG O
BIG OMEGA
BIG THETA

RUNTIME COMPLEXITIES
1.  O(1) / Constant -> For any given input the execution time wont change
2.  O(N) / Linear -> e.g Looping through an array depends on how many elements are available in the array
3.  O(LogN) / Algorithmic -> e.g finding a number in a sorted array
4.  0(N^2)  / Quadratic -> Looping through an array twice or double for loop
5. 0(2^N)  / Exponential -> e.g Recursion for instance Fibonacci
